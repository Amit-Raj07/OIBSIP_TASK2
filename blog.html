          <h3 >Virat Kohli quits Test captaincy, a day after series defeat against Proteas</h3>
          <br>
          <p class="para">
            The inevitable came a bit early as Virat Kohli on Saturday quit as
            India's Test captain, saying he did his job with "absolute honesty"
            and time was right to quit the leadership role. Kohli's announcement
            came a day after India suffered an embarrassing Test series defeat
            against South Africa. Kohli was dealing with one controversy after
            another as he was recently removed as ODI captain by the BCCI after
            he decided to step down at Twenty20 captain. His decision to quit as
            Test skipper has come at a time when his relation with the BCCI is
            so strained that he preferred to announce his decision on social
            media. Kohli was appointed Test captain back in 2014 when M S Dhoni
            stepped down in the middle of the series against Australia. "Every
            thing has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain
            of India, it's now," Kohli wrote in a statement which he posted on
            Twitter, taking everyone by surprise. "There have been many ups and
            also some downs along the journey but there has never been lack of
            effort or lack of belief." Interestingly, when Kohli had quit T20
            captaincy, he had also posted his message on social media. "It's
            been seven years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance
            everyday to take the team in the right direction. I have done the
            job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there," he wrote in
            his statement. Kohli led India to the top of world rankings and
            during his tenure, the team recorded a memorable series win in
            Australia.
